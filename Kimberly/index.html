            <h2>Information about Coronavirus and Quarantine</h2>
            <p>What is Coronavirus and how has it affected many people?<br></p>
            <p>Coronavirus (Covid-19) is a disease that started early in the year. Symptoms of this disease include: fever, coughs, shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle and body aches, etc. Other warnings in a person are confusion, trouble breathing, pain and pressure in the chest, inability to stay alert, and changes in the color of the face. Due to the rapid spread of the disease over one million people worldwide have died. Those who have severe medical conditions like heart or lung diseases and diabetes are likely to contract the disease and have serious complications. Those who did not and have not developed Covid-19 in their body have quarantined to avoid getting infected to protect those around them and themselves.</p>
            
            <p>How has quarantine changed the way people live?<br></p>
            <p>Quarantine was imposed when the numbers of cases rised dramatically. Since the comencement of the outbreak the way we live has changed. Schools were closed, forcing students to learn remotely and many adults were left unemployed. Staying at home has caused people to deal with their new lifestyle from home preventing them from associating with others in person. This has affected many emotionally and physically because they do not accept having to be confined within four walls. Due to this many have resorted to eating to forget about the current situation. Quarantine has brought a level of stress upon everyone whether people are not employed and have bills to pay, or students are learning remotely with a huge amount of work. </p>
