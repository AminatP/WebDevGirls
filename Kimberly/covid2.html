      <p align="justify">This website is called Healthy Tips to get Through Quarantine. People's lives have changed due to the pandemic
        and many problems have come along with it such as not eating healthy, being unproductive, and/or not interacting
        with others due to quarantine. This website explains how the coronavirus has affected many whether it is students
        or unemployed workers. Also, it lists some of the symptoms that can be experienced if one contracts the virus.
        There are many ways to live a healthy lifestyle such as doing a workout routine early in the morning to boost your
        energy and get fit, play board games to distract yourself from your phone, and meditate to distress and release
        all the negativity. The goal is to be healthy in general by doing the activities that we all enjoy and at the
        end be satisfied with what we have accomplished. Hope you can all find useful information!</p>
