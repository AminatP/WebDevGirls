                  <p class="card-text">Energy sources such as solar, wind, hydropower and more are all examples
                    of renewable energy sources. Renewable energy or clean energy derives from natural resources
                    such as light form the sun, the wind and water. These resources are sustainable because they
                    can be constantly replenshied. Meaning you can always have it; for example you can never run out of
                    sunlight or wind. Fossil fuels on the other hand can and will run out eventually whch means those
                    who deppend on it (otherwise known as humans) for energy will eventually not have the resources
                    for their electricty and heating and similar things. When you use renewable resources you have a
                    guarantee that it won't run out. All in all: SWITCH TO RENEWABLE ENERGY!

                  <h5 class="card-title">Sustainable Transportation</h5>
                  <p class="card-text"> Sustainable transportation is green transportation. Any means of transportation
                    that has a low impact on the environment. Some examples include: walking, cycling, transit, carpool,
                    and energy-efficient vechiles like electric cars. As many cars and other forms of transportation
                    contribute to  pollution, it is very important to try and lower your carbon footprint. Try alternate
                    forms of transport. It reduces the world's energy consumption and carbon dioxide emmissions, to ensure
                    cleaner air for all. So keep in mind to SWITCH TO A CLEAN, GREEN MACHINE!

                  <p class="card-text"> In short, pricing carbon is like a tax on pollution. It is a cost on the amount of carbon pollution one can emit.
                    This motivates polluters to reduce their carbon emmisions. This innovative method is one of the most efficient ways to cap
                    global warming. It is an easy and as mentioned earlier an efficient way to lower pollution. This strategy is already being put in use
                    and has a promising outlook. Hopefully, this tax will help put a stop to climate change. To wrap things up: BE NICE AND PAY THE CARBON PRICE!

                  <p class="card-text"> As we know, deforestation is big contributor to global warming. Protecting these forests are important. This solution helps
                    to preserve and protect the forest. Our tall green friends are dying. Around 1 football field of trees is lost per second. In 2016 we lost 28million hecatres
                  of trees. We use them for paper, pencils, furniture etc. There are so many items we use trees for. The demand is overwhelming,
                that's why it's so important to protect these forest. Certain forests or sections of forests are being protected and you can not harm the trees
              there. This way we are still preserving the wonders that trees have to offer us. Always: STAY A TREE HUGGER! </p>
