                  you might be wondering about what you can do to help. Well, there are a variety of options, 
                  whether it be little things or huge ones. Remember that no matter what you do, 
                  you are still making a big change and helping the Earth flourish.</p>

                    Wildfires are more likely to spike, as the hot and dry temperatures as well as deforestation 
                    increase the risk of them. Hurricanes become stronger as they increase in number, duration 
                    and intensity. More water vapor is evaporated which fuels the hungry storms. Flooding will also
                    occur with heavy precipitation. Natural disasters will only increase in the coming years.

                  <p class="card-text">Air quaity changes as more toxins are released into the air which makes it
                    dangerous to breath. When the air is less healthy to breathe, it affects our health and wellbeing.
                    Higher temperatures often result in an increase of allergens and air pollutants. This toxic air
                  will be harmful to animals as well and will be fatal. Many species will be negatively affected and
                  it will throw the entire animal kingdom out of balance. Poor air quality can also irritate the eyes,
                   nose, and throat, aggravate respiratory conditions, and affect the heart. Long term affects include
                   heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory diseases. It can also damage your  people's nerves, liver,
                   brain, kidneys, and other organs

                  <h5 class="card-title">Water Effects</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">Water is a main victim of climate change. Essentialy, climate change is all 
                  about water. In fact when you observe all the effects of climate change, you will see that 
                 most of them have water as their source. Regarding evapration, warmer air holds more moisture
                this means that the air will absorb more water and results in drier conditions. It also can 
             make the especially hot days extremely humid; overheating the body and blocking out sweat. 
            Eventually the moisture packed air leads to precipitation and heavier storms. Some areas are expected
          to get drier and this results in more droughts. Sea life is being affected by these conditions and this
        affects the food chain. Glaciers and ice are melting and this contributes to rising sea levels and 
      harms the fauna that live within the icy chanbers. In addition, there is more rain rather than snow which
    means that the snow that slowly melts and adds to freshwater resources and replenishes drinking water supplies 
  is fading away. This leads to drier conditions later in the year and water shortages. It also harms the wildlife
that depend on it. </p>
