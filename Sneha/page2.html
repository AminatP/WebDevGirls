                  <p class="card-text">Climate change or global warming is largely caused by the greenhouse effect.
                       The greenhouse effect is simple: We are entirely dependent on the energy from the Sun.
                        Most of the light reaching Earth's atmosphere goes through the clouds and the air, 
                        eventually to the surface. This is where it is absorbed and radiated back to space 
                        in the form of heat. A huge percentage of this heat is sucked up by the greenhouse gases 
                       and bounces back to the surface. </p>

                <h5 class="card-title">Pollution</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Pollution refers to anything that has a negative impact
                    on the environment or organisms that live there. There are five major types of pollution.
                They include, air, water, soil, light and noise pollution. The main pollution that contribute 
            to global warming is air pollution. This air pollution derives from houses, electricity, factories, 
            cars and power plants that burn fossil fuels. Fossil fuels include: coal, oil, natural gas and gasoline.
            The result is heat trapping gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. </p>

                <h5 class="card-title">Littering</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Littering and waste is another source of climate change. A lot of waste (other than sewage)
                    ends up in dumpsters or landfills. This organice material decomposes and releaser toxins 
                    such as methane and carbon dioxide. This builds up and has and has a lasting impact on climate 
                change. Litter outlives us all. It survives for long periods of time and directly affects
                climate change. For example plastic generates greenhouse gases even after it has been discarded
                and these emissions contribute to heating up the planet.</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">Deforestation</h5>
                <p class="card-body">Deforestation is a major cause of climate change. Trees and other plants 
                    are crucial in the fight against climate change. But we lose our vital partner when we damage 
                    these ecosystems. Deforestation in its whole is the act of removing trees from a wide area of
                    space. This may not seem like a big problem but trees are important because they take in carbon 
                    dioxide and release oxygen. By removing carbon dioxide, they are reducing the levels of this heat
                    trapping gas. They also emit oxygen for us to breath. This balance is key, and we must protect it.
                    Deforestation cuts down trees and ejects more and more carbon dioxide. Having this continue with
                    no restrictions will be fatal.</p>
